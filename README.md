<p>A few years ago I realized that I wanted to focus my efforts on being useful. For this reason, I'm trying to contribute more and more to open-source projects, helping people on Discus, StackOverflow, Spectrum, Github discussions... and creating useful content to be used by developers: libraries and articles.</p>
##  ðŸ§¡   My passions <br>
- Technology and software <br>
- Science <br>
- Machine learning (my articles about it) <br>
- Books (goodreads) <br>
- Parkour (instagram, youtube) <br>
- Nutrition <br>
